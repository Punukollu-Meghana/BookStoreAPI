BookStoreAPI - A Java Spring Boot Application

This repository contains the source code for a RESTful API for managing a bookstore's inventory. The application is built using Java and the Spring Boot framework.


Project Overview

The BookStoreAPI provides a robust backend service for a bookstore application. It allows clients to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a collection of books. The API is designed with modern best practices, leveraging the power of the Spring ecosystem to create a scalable and maintainable web service.

Key Features

RESTful Architecture: The API adheres to REST principles, offering a clean and predictable interface for interacting with book resources.

Comprehensive Book Management: It provides a full suite of endpoints for managing books, including adding new titles, retrieving book information, updating existing entries, and removing books from the database.

Layered Architecture: The project follows a classic layered architecture (Controller, Service, Repository), promoting separation of concerns and making the code easier to manage and test.

Database Integration with JPA: Uses Spring Data JPA (Java Persistence API) for seamless and efficient interaction with a relational database.

Technologies Used

Java: The core programming language for the application.
Spring Boot: The primary framework used for building the application, providing auto-configuration, an embedded web server, and simplified dependency management.
Spring Web: For building the RESTful controllers and handling HTTP requests.
Spring Data JPA: To simplify data access layers and interact with the database.
Hibernate: The default JPA implementation used by Spring Boot for Object-Relational Mapping (ORM).
Maven: A powerful project management and comprehension tool used for building the project and managing its dependencies.
H2 Database (or other configured DB): The project is likely configured with an in-memory database like H2 for ease of development, but can be easily configured to work with other relational databases like PostgreSQL or MySQL.
API Endpoints


The BookStoreAPI exposes the following endpoints to manage the book collection:
HTTP Method	Endpoint	Description
POST	/api/books	Adds a new book to the database.
GET	/api/books	Retrieves a list of all books.
GET	/api/books/{id}	Fetches a single book by its unique ID.
PUT	/api/books/{id}	Updates the details of an existing book.
DELETE	/api/books/{id}	Removes a book from the database.
Note: The base path /api may vary depending on the final configuration.
